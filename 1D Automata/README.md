One-dimensional cellular automata (1D CA) are computational models that consist of a linear arrangement of cells, each in one of two possible states (often represented as 0 or 1). The evolution of the system occurs over discrete time steps. At each step, the state of each cell is updated based on a rule that considers its current state and the states of its immediate neighbors. The rule defines the new state of a cell as a function of the current configuration. 1D cellular automata exhibit diverse behaviors, ranging from stable and repetitive patterns to complex and chaotic dynamics, making them a fundamental concept in the study of emergent complexity.
